// constructing vectors
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main ()
{
  unsigned int i;

  // constructors used in the same order as described above:
  vector<int> first;                                // empty vector of ints
  vector<int> second (4,100);                       // four ints with value 100
  vector<int> third (second.begin(),second.end());  // iterating through second
  vector<int> fourth (third);                       // a copy of third

  // the iterator constructor can also be used to construct from arrays:
  int myints[] = {16,2,77,29};
  vector<int> fifth (myints, myints + sizeof(myints) / sizeof(int) );

  cout << "The contents of fifth are:";
  for (i=0; i < fifth.size(); i++)
    cout << " " << fifth[i];

  cout << endl;

  return 0;
}
